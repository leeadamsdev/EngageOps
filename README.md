# EngageOps

EngageOps is an independently designed, multi-tenant workforce operations application.
It manages organisations, clients, workers and assignments through an ASP.NET Core
API, with a React workspace for organisation access and client/worker management.

## Implemented functionality

| Area           | API                                                                           | Browser workspace                                                 |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authentication | Registration, cookie sign-in, session lookup, sign-out and antiforgery tokens | Sign-in, session handling and sign-out                            |
| Organisations  | Account/organisation provisioning and membership-scoped listing               | Organisation picker, workspace overview, client/worker totals and switching |
| Clients        | Organisation-scoped creation and paginated listing                            | Inline creation, paginated listing and loading/empty/error states |
| Workers        | Organisation-scoped creation and paginated listing                            | Inline creation, paginated listing and loading/empty/error states |
| Assignments    | Creation, paginated listing, detail and cancellation                          | API only                                                          |

Assignments link a worker and client within the same organisation, with a start date,
optional end date and a `Confirmed` or `Cancelled` status. Access is controlled by
organisation membership, with tenant relationships also enforced in PostgreSQL.

## Stack

- **Backend:** C# / .NET 10, ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs, EF Core, Npgsql and ASP.NET Core Identity.
- **Frontend:** React 19, strict TypeScript, Vite, React Router, TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS and React Icons.
- **Data:** PostgreSQL, with EF Core migrations.
- **Testing:** xUnit v3 with Microsoft.Testing.Platform, PostgreSQL Testcontainers, Vitest, React Testing Library and Playwright with axe accessibility checks.
- **Tooling:** Docker Compose, GitHub Actions, CodeQL and dependency monitoring.

The backend is a single feature-oriented API project. The frontend has matching
feature folders for the implemented browser workflows.

## Run locally

The local workflow supports Windows (PowerShell) and macOS/Linux (a standard shell)
with Docker running Linux containers. Follow [Local development](docs/local-development.md)
to configure and start the Compose services, then use [Local demo data](docs/development-data.md) to seed an
account with empty, small and paginated client and worker lists. The browser workspace runs at
<http://localhost:5173>.
